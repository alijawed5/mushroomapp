# mushroomapp
This is an app that predicts that a mushroom is poisonous or not looking at various features.

App requirements:
1. Python 3
2. Streamlit
3. Text Editor (I used VSCODE)

This rep contains both the code and the notebook for the app.
The notebook contains all the working done before hand and the code is the actual code to run the app.
